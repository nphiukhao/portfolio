            <p>I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Bachelors of Science in Biology. 
                    Before starting my journey to full stack developer(-hood), I was a Research Assistant at UCSDs Biochemistry 
                    Department performing chemical quality assurance and reagent development. My excitement for coding comes 
                    from its’ potential to create impactful applications. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and 
                    to grow in any opportunity. Ultimately, I want to advance health technology by 
                    leveraging my biology background and technical experience.
